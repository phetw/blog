I thought it was cool and relaxing. It was the time that you get to chat with all your friends, telling jokes, listen to each other's problems. I had convinced myself that it helps me concentrate and focus more. So yeah, I did smoke a lot during the time of exams and it somewhat helped. I could remember the picture of every page of the Physics book.</p>\n<p>Although I studied in a boarding school at the times, I always find a way to get cigarettes inside to share among my friends. Sometimes I even smoke local cigarettes that tasted like burning dry grass, but it was manageable as it was so cheap and it stops the craving. The crave was real, trust me.</p>\n<p>I play football regularly during my high school years. I did notice a slow decline in my stamina and in my last year of high school, it only takes 20 minutes of football to exhaust my lungs. I couldn't run much.</p>\n<p>During college, football was once in a while thing. Party was regularly. Most of the time drinking, smoking was like a perfect match. Yeah, I did enjoy both and they kill you. I drink like there was no tomorrow. Chiang Rai offered me peace, nice weathered, cheap beers. What else do you need?</p>\n<p>I noticed that during exam time, it was a different version of me. I was not able to remember things as good as before. I forget things more often. I assumed it was the alcohol and I blame myself for it.</p>\n<p>The life-changing pivot was when I first started working 6 months ago. Work was a lot of fun. I love what I do a lot. I still smoke every break I get. One day, there was a heavy smog consist of very tiny dust particle that your body cannot naturally filter it out. I, who was already allergic to dust was heavily affected. I got sick so bad that I thought I was going to die. My body temperature was over 39.5 degrees, it was burning.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, I got sick very often while working in Bangkok.</p>\n<p>It was the office syndrome. I have no choice as the part of my job is to solve problems using my coding skills and that, I have to sit in front of a computer.</p>\n<p>I started to exercise regularly and set a quit smoking goal like I did many times before which all ended up failed. Instead of smoking every break I get, I code. I even code during my free time. I love it. This time was a success.</p>\n<p>I don't smoke anymore. Not even while drinking. Not even when I need concentration. Not even when my friends are smoking. I have become a person that hated the smoke and I always try to stay away from smokers. Strange thing is that, I did not miss smoking at all. I've successfully convince myself not to use cigarettes as the solution to every problem. There was always better solutions. I was very proud.</p>\n<p>However, one may have different solutions and strategies in quitting. For me, it's just a matter your willingness. If you have a strong will and stay focus, you can achieve anything in life.</p>","excerpt":"I started smoking since the age of 16. I thought it was cool and relaxing.
