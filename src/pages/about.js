      <Topic>What I do</Topic>
      <p>
        I love building a highly performant, beautiful and easy-to-use websites
        and these are things that I always try to achieve when building one. In
        past years, my works primarily focus on front-end web development with
        React.js and few of Angular projects. I also do mini projects on Github
        during my free time, check them out.
      </p>
      <Topic>Other interests</Topic>
      <p>
        I like readings and writing, but I tends to forget very easily. Which is
        the reason why I started writing personal blogs. I also dedicated a fair
        amount of my free time into the blockchain technology including both
        public and private kinds of blockchain which I believe both could
        disrupt many industries in coming years.
