Walking happens naturally. I don't have to think (Unless you live in Bangkok, and have to avoid footpath bombs that spills stinky mud). I could use time during the walks to think about something else. I have an extra time with myself. I can observe surroundings, if new shops or restaurant opens I would know.

I don't have to get stuck at traffics.

I don't need to beware of my surroundings.

I don't have to fight with motorbike taxi or food delivery bikes which 99% of them rides really fast and recklessly as they have to race against time and they unlikely to respect any traffic laws.

I always walk when it's around one kilometer. It's an optimum distance for me. Not too tired and not too short.
