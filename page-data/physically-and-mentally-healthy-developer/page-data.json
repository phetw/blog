I think most of us will probably know that it is not healthy and considered to be a bad practice to sit continuously for a long time. It can cause a lot of health issues like back pain, neck strain or even office syndrome.</p>\n<p>I've had experience with these symptoms and I would like to share my tips to tackle this problem.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sit correctly.</strong></h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, if the large portion of the time at office is sitting, sit well. There are plenty of references regarding correct sitting position, but I always refer to this one. Plus, this will also help to maintain a good your posture while standing or walking. Finally, if possible get a chair with good ergonomic.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-left:0!important;margin-right:0!important; max-width: 275px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/blog/static/30a69d8bb3024f2209c46c674ca1e634/2263d/correct-sitting-posture-diagram-at-a-computer-desk.webp 200w,\n/blog/static/30a69d8bb3024f2209c46c674ca1e634/32738/correct-sitting-posture-diagram-at-a-computer-desk.webp 275w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/blog/static/30a69d8bb3024f2209c46c674ca1e634/23638/correct-sitting-posture-diagram-at-a-computer-desk.jpg 200w,\n/blog/static/30a69d8bb3024f2209c46c674ca1e634/aafc3/correct-sitting-posture-diagram-at-a-computer-desk.jpg 275w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/blog/static/30a69d8bb3024f2209c46c674ca1e634/aafc3/correct-sitting-posture-diagram-at-a-computer-desk.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Sitting position\"\n          title=\"Sitting position\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<h2><strong>Take a break.</strong></h2>\n<p>Just get up. I understand that at times with programming work need a lot of concentration and when I concentrate on something, I tend to forget to do another. I always try to remind myself as much as possible, or maybe set a small alarm or reminder to get up every hour or something. </p>\n<h2><strong>Exercise, any exercise.</strong></h2>\n<p>Any exercise. Even a small exercise during office hours will do. It's even better if you can go jog or play any sports regularly once or twice a week. There are also many scientific proves that exercises can help you think clearly and make better decisions. </p>\n<h2><strong>Sleep early and sleep well.</strong></h2>\n<p>In my own theory, sleeping isn't all about hour of sleeping. Well, try to compare sleeping early and getting up early with sleeping late and getting up late and see which one gives you a fresher morning. Additionally, if exercise regularly, it will result in a healthy sleep. It is all linked.</p>","excerpt":"Majority of the software developers sit in front of computer monitor for roughly 7-8 hours or more per day depending on the work place.
