You get to know where you stand among the markets, you will know your level of ability. Sometimes tough interview or the one you did not do well can bring you down, but that's okay you will know what to practise and improve on. If you do well in an interview, it will definitely grow your confidence and encouragement to learn more. <strong>These experiences are priceless, go for it.</strong> Not only technical abilities, you will need a decent soft skills when conveying the message to them. Both are crucial traits for a software developers.</p>\n<h2>You get to know what the others are doing.</h2>\n<p>In most of the interview, either the interviewer will tell you about themselves or there will be a session where you can ask questions about them. This is your time, test them and get the most out of it. Get to know their tech stacks, the reasons behind the decision, team sizes, team workflow, company's businesses etc. These might help you do your work some or the other ways in the future.</p>\n<h2>You get out of your comfort zone</h2>\n<p>When working at a company for a certain amount of time, you adapt and make yourself comfortable like you're at home. That is all good, but a coin always has two sides. You fall into the comfort zone. In some cases, some tends to stay at a company even they know that they are under-paid. When you explore and go for interview, you will know that better opportunities await you. Especially in Thailand, where most of the company does not value software developers and therefore, the pay role does not go along with the growth of technology. Sometimes, it is better to move on to the other company, and this is the reasons why turn over rate of many tech company is so high and job as a tech recruiter is spreading like a virus.</p>\n<p>However, these are all my personal opinion and experiences. Hope you find something useful.</p>","excerpt":"I recently attend several interview sessions and thought of sharing things that I have discovered and learned throughout these interviews.
